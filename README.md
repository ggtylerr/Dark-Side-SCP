## What works at the moment
* Hopefully anything that doesn't have any special styles made for that page.
* The ACS, along with the special warning image.
* Collapsible stuff.
* Any link that doesn't directly go to the wiki.
* OpenGraph embeds *(mostly.)*
* Mobile viewing (hopefully without much issues)

## What doesn't work
* Mostly anything that *does* have a special style made for them.
* Footnotes.
* Any link that directly goes to the wiki.
* Forums.
* Descriptions in OpenGraph embeds.

## What will most likely never work
* Ratings.
* Site tools.
* Editing.
* Pretty much anything that involves needing an account or sending information to the server. This is intended as a viewer, not a full on replacement.

## What is planned
* Fixes to the "what doesn't work" set.
* Themes.
* Utilization of the Wikidot API instead of horrid web scraping.
* Possibly user default colors (?)

## Legal mumbo jumbo
I (ggtylerr) own basically close to nothing on this project.

The main dark theme is copied from multiple elements from different themes, websites, and so on. These include:
* Wikidot
* SCP-Wiki
* Black Highlighter
* Whatever that theme is called by djkaktus (or at least the one he keeps using)
* SCP Night Mode (By Blyad on Stylish)
* Probably a couple more that I'm forgetting

This website is hosted on repl.it. Contents of any page is made by their respective author.

This website is under the CC BY-SA 3.0 license, however, I'm not a legal expert and some of the themes I listed might have some legal stuff I missed.

If you take a look at the website, you might see a couple of google ads elements. This is from the original website itself. The Dark Side SCP viewer does not have any form of collecting revenue, not even through donations.

Please don't sue me. This project is not for profit or recognition, I simply wanted to read some SCP stuff without straining my eyes (and without random broken stuff.)
